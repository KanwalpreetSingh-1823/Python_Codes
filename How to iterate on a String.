# Example :- To find how many times 'l' appears in the string by iterating through each character in the string.
# Method-1
count = 0
str = "Hello World"
for letter in str:
    if letter == "l":
        count = count + 1
print(count) 

# Method-2 -- By iterating through each Index in the string.
count = 0
str = "Hello World"
for i in range(len(str)):
    if str[i] == "l":
        count=count+1
print(count)
